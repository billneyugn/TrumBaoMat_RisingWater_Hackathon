# ðŸŽ¨ Rising Waters: Visual Design & Asset Generation Prompts

## Modern UI/UX Design System

### Design Philosophy
- "Create a clean, professional interface inspired by modern web applications"
- "Implement Google Material Design principles for consistency and usability"
- "Design with accessibility in mind: high contrast, clear typography, intuitive navigation"
- "Focus on content clarity over decorative elements"

### Color Palette & Theme
- "Primary: Google Material Blue (#1976d2) for main interface elements"
- "Secondary: Deep Orange (#ff7043) for accents and highlights"
- "Status Colors: Success Green (#4caf50), Warning Orange (#ff9800), Danger Red (#f44336)"
- "Neutral: Light backgrounds (#fafafa) with dark text (#212121) for readability"

### Typography System
- "Primary Font: Poppins for modern, clean readability across all devices"
- "Font weights: 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semi-bold), 700 (bold)"
- "Hierarchical sizing: 2.5rem (titles), 1.5rem (headings), 1rem (body), 0.875rem (captions)"
- "Optimal line-height: 1.6 for body text, 1.4 for headings"

### Layout & Structure
- "Responsive grid system adapting to screen sizes"
- "Card-based design with subtle shadows and rounded corners"
- "Consistent spacing using 8px grid system"
- "Flexible layouts that work from mobile (320px) to desktop (1920px+)"

### Interactive Elements
- "Button Design: Material Design elevation with hover states"
- "Form Elements: Clean inputs with focus states and validation feedback"
- "Navigation: Intuitive menu structure with clear visual hierarchy"
- "Modals: Centered overlays with backdrop blur and smooth transitions"

### Visual Feedback Systems
- "Metric Bars: Smooth animations with color-coded progress indicators"
- "Action Buttons: Clear states (default, hover, active, disabled)"
- "Loading States: Subtle spinners and skeleton screens"
- "Success/Error: Toast notifications and inline validation messages"

### Iconography & Graphics
- "Minimalist approach: Use text labels over icons for clarity"
- "Consistent visual language throughout the interface"
- "SVG-based graphics for crisp rendering at all sizes"
- "Emoji sparingly, only for event categorization when necessary"

### Animation & Motion
- "Subtle micro-interactions: 200-300ms transitions"
- "Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) for natural motion"
- "Ocean wave backgrounds: Gentle, non-distracting animations"
- "Performance-first: GPU-accelerated transforms only"

### Responsive Design Strategy
- "Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement"
- "Breakpoints: 320px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop)"
- "Touch-friendly: 44px minimum touch targets"
- "Content prioritization: Most important information first"

### Accessibility Features
- "WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for color contrast"
- "Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements"
- "Screen reader friendly with proper ARIA labels"
- "Focus indicators visible and consistent"

### Performance Considerations
- "Optimized assets: Compressed images and minified CSS/JS"
- "Efficient rendering: Minimal DOM manipulation and repaints"
- "Fast loading: Critical CSS inlined, non-critical loaded asynchronously"
- "Progressive enhancement: Core functionality works without JavaScript"

### Brand Identity
- "Professional, educational tone suitable for institutional use"
- "Trust-building visual elements: Clean layouts, consistent spacing"
- "Modern aesthetic appealing to diverse age groups"
- "Culturally neutral design with Vietnamese localization support"
