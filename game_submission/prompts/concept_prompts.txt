# ðŸŒŠ Rising Waters: Concept & Brainstorming Prompts

## Initial Game Concept Prompts

### Core Game Concept
- "Create an educational board game about flood preparedness for Vietnamese communities"
- "Design a single-player strategy game that teaches disaster management through gameplay"
- "Make a game where players become community leaders during flood season"
- "Create an 8-round game that takes about 10 minutes to complete"

### Educational Objectives
- "Teach flood preparedness through interactive decision-making"
- "Include real-world flood safety tips and Vietnamese disaster management practices"
- "Create quizzes that test knowledge of evacuation procedures and emergency response"
- "Make players understand the importance of early warning systems and dike maintenance"

### Game Mechanics Design
- "Design 4 key metrics: Safety, Infrastructure, Morale, and Resource Points"
- "Create a system where players must balance competing priorities with limited resources"
- "Make events randomized so each game feels different"
- "Include a win condition that requires both Safety â‰¥ 70% and Infrastructure â‰¥ 60%"

### Cultural Context
- "Base scenarios on Vietnam's geography: Mekong Delta, Red River, typhoon-prone regions"
- "Include culturally appropriate community leadership concepts"
- "Reference ASEAN disaster management guidelines and Vietnamese Ministry guidelines"
- "Make the game accessible to both Vietnamese and English speakers"

### Strategic Depth
- "Create three distinct strategies: Prepare (proactive), Defend (reactive), Recover (adaptive)"
- "Design actions with different costs and effects to create meaningful trade-offs"
- "Make resource management challenging but not frustrating"
- "Ensure replayability through randomized events and multiple winning paths"

### Learning Integration
- "Embed educational content naturally into gameplay"
- "Provide immediate feedback on decisions through metric changes"
- "Include safety tips after each action to reinforce learning"
- "Make quizzes optional but rewarding (+2 Resource Points for correct answers)"

### Accessibility & Localization
- "Support both English and Vietnamese languages with full localization"
- "Make the game work completely offline (no internet required)"
- "Design for multiple screen sizes: desktop, tablet, and mobile"
- "Ensure the game is accessible to players with different technical backgrounds"

### Technical Requirements
- "Use only HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)"
- "Store all game data in JSON format for easy modification"
- "Make the game load quickly and run smoothly on older devices"
- "Design modular code structure for easy maintenance and extension"
