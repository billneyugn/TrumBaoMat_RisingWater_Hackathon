# 📊 Round Counter Update

## Overview

Updated the game to ensure the **round counter reflects the current round immediately** every time a player chooses an action.

---

## Changes Made

### **1. executeAction() - Immediate Visual Feedback**

**File:** `main.js`

**Added:**
```javascript
// Update UI immediately
updateMeters();
updateRoundDisplay(); // Explicitly update round counter for immediate visual feedback
renderActions(); // Re-render actions to reflect updated RP
```

**Why:**
- When a player chooses an action, the round counter now updates instantly
- Provides immediate visual feedback that the action was processed
- Players can see the current round at any time during action selection
- Action buttons also re-render to reflect updated Resource Points

**Previous Flow:**
```
Player chooses action → Action effects applied → Tip shown → 
Player acknowledges → Next round incremented → New event drawn
```

**New Flow:**
```
Player chooses action → Action effects applied → ROUND UPDATED ✨ →
Metrics displayed → Actions re-rendered → Tip shown → 
Player acknowledges → Next round incremented → ROUND UPDATED AGAIN ✨ →
New event drawn
```

### **2. processNextRound() - Explicit Update**

**File:** `main.js`

**Added:**
```javascript
function processNextRound() {
  gameState.currentRound++;
  updateRoundDisplay(); // Update round counter display immediately
  
  // ... rest of function
}
```

**Why:**
- When transitioning to the next round, the display updates immediately
- No delay in showing the new round number
- Players always see accurate round information

## Visual Behavior

### **Before Update:**
```
Round 1: Event appears
         Player clicks action
         ⏳ Round counter might not update until tip is acknowledged
         Player sees Round 1 → Acknowledges tip → NOW sees Round 2
```

### **After Update:**
```
Round 1: Event appears
         Player clicks action
         ✨ Round counter updates IMMEDIATELY to show Round 1
         Player sees action effects AND round clearly displayed
         Acknowledges tip
         ✨ Round counter updates AGAIN as Round 2 begins
         Round 2: New event appears
```
